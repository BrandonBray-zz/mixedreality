# Plug in your headset

## Identify USB 3.0 port

Identify the USB 3.0 port on your computer and plug in the USB cable. USB 3.0 ports have SS (Super Speed) written next to them. They are often (but not always) colored blue.

## Identify HDMI out port

Identify the **HDMI out** port on your computer and plug in the HDMI cable. Make sure you are **not** plugging into the HDMI in port!

## Connect headphones to headset

Unless you purchased a Samsung HMD Odyssey headset (which has integrated AKG headphones and an integrated dual-array microphone), you will need to get an audio headset a pair of headphones that can plug into your HMD’s headset's 3.5mm audio jack.

## Common issues
* Make sure to plug in the USB 3.0 cable **before** plugging in the HDMI cable
* If you are using a Bluetooth dongle, do not plug in your HMD's USB cable next to that dongle as the resulting radio interference may negatively impact Bluetooth performance

## My PC doesn't have an HDMI port; I may need an adapter

Note: There is an older Surface Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter that only supports 1080p and does not work!
